        <p>We use cookies to optimize our website. A cookie is a small text file that is sent by the respective servers when you visit a website and is temporarily stored on your hard drive. This file as such contains a so-called session ID with which various requests from your browser can be assigned to the shared session. This enables your computer to be recognised when you return to our website. These cookies are deleted after you close your browser. They serve, for example, to enable you to use the shopping basket function over several pages.</p>
        <p>We also use persistent cookies (also small text files that are stored on your terminal device) to a small extent, which remain on your terminal device and enable us to recognize your browser the next time you visit us. These cookies are stored on your hard drive and delete themselves after the specified time. Their lifetime is 1 month. This enables us to present our offer to you in a more user-friendly, effective and secure manner and, for example, to display information on the site that is specially tailored to your interests.</p>
        <p>Our legitimate interest in the use of cookies in accordance with Art 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 f) GDPR is to make our website more user-friendly, more effective and safer.</p>
        <p>The following data and information are stored in the cookies:</p>

Your name, your IP address or similar data that would allow the cookie to be assigned to you will not be placed in the cookie. On the basis of cookie technology, we only receive pseudonymized information, for example about which pages of our portal have been visited, which products have been viewed, etc.</p>
        <p>You can set your browser so that you are informed in advance about the setting of cookies and can decide in each individual case whether you want to exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally, or whether cookies should be prevented completely.

        <p>The data will be deleted after expiry of the warranty periods and statutory retention periods. Data that is linked to a user account (see below) is retained in any case for the time that this account is maintained.</p>
        <p>The legal basis for the processing of this data is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 b) GDPR, because this data is required to enable us to fulfil our contractual obligations towards you.</p>

        <p>To ensure your proper registration and to prevent unauthorized logins by third parties, you will receive an activation link by e-mail after your registration to activate your account. Only after successful registration do we permanently store the data you provide in our system.</p>
        <p>You can have a user account, once created, deleted by us at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates. A message in text form to the contact data mentioned under point 1 (e.g. e-mail, fax, letter) is sufficient for this purpose. We will then delete your stored personal data, unless we still need to store them for the processing of orders or due to legal storage obligations.</p>

This is necessary to prevent third parties from registering with your email address.</p>
        <p>You can revoke your consent to receive the newsletter at any time and thus cancel the newsletter.</p>
        <p>We store the registration data as long as they are needed to send the newsletter.

The legal basis for the logging of the registration is our legitimate interest in proof that the dispatch was carried out with your consent.</p>

In this way, we send you information about travel products from our range that you may be interested in based on your recent purchases of goods or services from us.

        <h4>3.8 E-Mail Contact</h4>
        <p>If you contact us (e.g. via contact form or e-mail), we will process your data to process the enquiry and in the event that follow-up questions arise.</p>
        <p>If the data processing is carried out to carry out pre-contractual measures which are carried out in response to your enquiry or, if you are already our customer, to carry out the contract, the legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 b) GDPR.</p>
        <p>We only process other personal data if you give your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 a) GDPR) or if we have a legitimate interest in processing your data (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 f) GDPR). A legitimate interest lies, for example, in replying to your e-mail.</p>

        <p>When exercising your right to data transfer in accordance with paragraph 1, you have the right to obtain that the personal data be transferred directly from us to another controller, insofar as this is technically feasible.</p>
        <h4>6.6 Right of objection</h4>
        <p>You have the right to object to the lawful processing of your personal data by us if this is justified by your particular situation and if our interests in the processing do not outweigh the processing.</p>
        <p>
            In detail: <br>You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 e) or f) of the GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. We no longer process personal data unless we can prove compelling reasons for processing that are worthy of protection and outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or unless the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
        </p>
        <p>Where personal data are processed by us for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object, at any time, to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing, including profiling, insofar as it relates to such direct marketing.</p>
        <p>You have the right to object, for reasons arising from your specific situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purposes of scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89, paragraph 1, GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.</p>
        <h4>6.7 Automated decisions including profiling</h4>
        <p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which has legal effect on you or which significantly affects you in a similar way.</p>
        <p>No automated decision making based on the personal data collected will take place.</p>
        <h4>6.8 Right to revoke a data protection consent</h4>

        <p>You have the right to complain to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data concerning you is unlawful.</p>
        <h3>7. Data security</h3>
        <p>We make every effort to ensure the security of your data within the framework of the applicable data protection laws and technical possibilities.</p>
        <p>Your personal data will be transmitted encrypted. This applies to your orders and also to the customer login. We use the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) coding system, but we would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
        <p>To protect your data, we maintain technical and organizational security measures in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR, which we continually adapt to the state of the art.</p>
        <p>We also do not guarantee that our offer is available at certain times; disturbances, interruptions or failures cannot be excluded. The servers used by us are regularly and carefully secured.</p>
        <h3>8. Transfer of data to third parties, no data transfer to non-EU countries</h3>
        <p>As a matter of principle, we only use your personal data within our company.</p>
        <p>If and to the extent that we involve third parties in the performance of contracts (such as logistics service providers), they will only receive personal data to the extent that the transmission is necessary for the corresponding service.</p>
        <p>In the event that we outsource certain parts of the data processing ("contract processing"), we contractually oblige contract processors to use personal data only in accordance with the requirements of the data protection laws and to ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.</p>
        <p>Data transmission to bodies or persons outside the EU outside the case mentioned in this declaration in section 4 does not take place and is not planned.</p>
